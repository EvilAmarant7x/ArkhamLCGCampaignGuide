    <!--Campaign introduction-->
    <string name="dunwich_introduction"><b>Prologue</b>\n
    \nDr. Henry Armitage pours himself a glass of pinot and sits down at his desk, gesturing for you to sit across
        from him. “I apologize for the short notice,” he begins. His face is pale, his forehead sweaty and wrinkled
        with worry.\n
    \nArmitage—the head librarian of Miskatonic University, and a former mentor of yours—privately contacted you in
        the hopes of gaining your assistance. Eager to help, you made your way to his home in Southside. Upon
        entering, you were surprised to find his home in disarray. Books and notes litter his desk, and an empty
        bottle of wine has tipped over onto the ground by the fireplace. You’d always known Armitage to be neat and
        well-organized.\n
    \nThe elderly man takes a moment to collect his thoughts. “I am looking for two of my colleagues—Dr. Francis
        Morgan, professor of archaeology, and Warren Rice, professor of languages. Warren was supposed to meet up
        with me over supper earlier today to discuss several important findings, but he has since gone missing. At
        first I thought nothing of it, but I have a nagging feeling something else is going on. A very…<b>familiar</b>
        feeling.” You’ve never seen Armitage quite this worried before. His hands tremble as he reaches for the glass
        on his desk, and he sips from it nervously. “I tried to find Francis, hoping he knew where Warren was, but he
        too is out of touch. Francis has been spending a lot of time in some gambling den, or so I am told.\n
    \n“I sent for you because I am worried Warren might be in trouble. I would appreciate it greatly if you could
        find him for me. You may also wish to ask Francis for help, if you can reach him.”</string>
    <string name="dunwich_start_option_one">Professor Warren Rice was last seen working late at night in the
        humanities department of Miskatonic University. Let’s search for him there.</string>
    <string name="dunwich_start_option_two">Dr. Francis Morgan was last seen gambling at the Clover Club, an upscale
        speakeasy and gambling joint located downtown. Let’s go talk to him.</string>


    <!--Scenario introductions-->
    <string name="extracurricular_introduction">Dr. Armitage is worried his colleague, Professor Warren Rice, might
        be in trouble, so he has asked for your help in finding his friend. He seems unreasonably nervous about his
        colleague’s disappearance considering Professor Rice has only been “missing” for a matter of hours…</string>

    <string name="house_introduction">Dr. Armitage suggested you track down his associate Dr. Francis Morgan. He’s
        not sure whether Dr. Morgan is in trouble, but he’s not particularly happy with his colleague’s present
        choice of company. He’s in the Clover Club, a notorious gambling joint somewhere downtown. Finding the club’s
        exact location isn’t easy—you have to grease a few palms just to learn which of the Downtown restaurants
        operates as the club’s front. That restaurant is La Bella Luna, a somewhat upscale Italian eatery by the
        theatre. You change into your Sunday best and make your way there.\n
    \nIn front of La Bella Luna stands a man in a pinstripe suit who sizes you up as you approach. “Enjoy
        yourselves,” he says with a snake-like grin as he holds open the restaurant’s front door.</string>

    <string name="armitage_interlude_one">You are more than a little rattled by your experiences in the university and
        the Clover Club. You’re not sure what to make of whoever—or whatever—was after Rice and Morgan. Worried about
        Dr. Armitage, you swiftly make your way back to his home. When you arrive, you find that the latches of his
        front door have been busted open, and his living area and study have been ransacked. Dr. Armitage is nowhere
        to be found. Searching his home, you find a journal the intruders didn’t steal tucked beneath several other
        documents in the bottom drawer of Armitage’s desk. The journal appears to be written in a strange language
        you cannot decode, using a script you’ve never seen in your entire life. Fortunately, it seems Dr. Armitage
        had already gone through the trouble of translating it into English. Apparently, it belongs to one “Wilbur
        Whateley.”\n
    \nThe journal—along with Armitage’s many notes—tells a startling tale, one you would scarcely believe had it not
        been for your harrowing experiences earlier tonight…</string>
    <string name="armitage_interlude_two">When you arrive at Dr. Armitage’s home in Southside, you find him sitting at
        his desk, pale-faced and sweating with worry. He is grateful to you for searching for his colleagues, but he
        doesn’t look relieved. With a long pause, he straightens his glasses and explains:\n
    \n“I’m afraid I must apologize. There’s something I didn’t mention to you earlier.” Dr. Armitage then spins a
        tale you would scarcely believe had it not been for your harrowing experiences earlier that night…\n
    \n<b>Any one investigator may choose to add Dr. Henry Armitage to his or her deck.</b></string>

    <string name="miskatonic_introduction_one">Several months ago, Armitage and his colleagues stopped a rampaging
        horror from tearing through Dunwich, a backwater town several hours north and west of Arkham. At first you
        imagine this beast as a rabid bear, or worse, but the professor’s description of the creature paints a
        different picture.\n
    \nIt all began when a man named Wilbur Whateley entered the Orne Library looking for Olaus Wormius’s Latin
        translation of a book called the Necronomicon. Wilbur already possessed a beaten-up English translation by
        Dr. John Dee, but it was insufficient for his purposes. Armitage turned the man away, fearing what use the
        strange man had for the book. Whateley returned in secret, hoping to steal the book, but was attacked by a
        hound guarding the university. Armitage, Rice, and Morgan later discovered Whateley’s body. A description of
        the foul corpse—semi-anthropomorphic and covered in fur, with a leathery hide and greenish-grey
        tentacles—causes you to question whether or not Whateley was truly human.\n
    \nThe notes written by Dr. Armitage in the journal stress Whateley’s desire to get his hands on the Necronomicon
        for some terrible purpose. As you read on, it seems that Dr. Armitage brought the university’s copy of the
        tome to Harold Walsted—the curator of the Miskatonic Museum—for safekeeping in the museum’s Restricted Hall.
        Although you are worried about your mentor, you are equally worried that Armitage’s kidnappers might get
        their hands on this Necronomicon. You decide to head to the museum to prevent them from acquiring it.</string>
    <string name="miskatonic_introduction_two">Several months ago, Armitage and his colleagues stopped a rampaging
        horror from tearing through Dunwich, a backwater town several hours north and west of Arkham. At first you
        imagine this beast as a rabid bear, or worse, but the professor’s description of the creature paints a

        tentacles—causes you to question whether or not Whateley was truly human.\n
    \n“My colleagues and I were quick to put the ordeal behind us,” Armitage says with a sigh. “But it seems that
        things haven’t fully resolved themselves. I’ll tell you the rest later, but for now, it is imperative that we
        get our hands on that copy of the Necronomicon. If my instincts are correct, the assailants you’ve
        encountered will be searching for it. After all that transpired, I didn’t feel safe keeping it at the
        library, so I brought it to my good friend, Harold Walsted. He is the current curator of the Miskatonic
        Museum. I thought it would be safe in the museum’s Restricted Hall, but now I’m not so sure. You must
        retrieve it at all costs! I fear terribly what they could do with the rites contained in its pages…”</string>

    <string name="essex_introduction">Recent events in the Museum have forced you to re-evaluate Armitage’s tale
        about Dunwich. It cannot be a coincidence—Wilbur Whateley, the Necronomicon, the creature from Dunwich, and
        the people and creatures who attacked here in Arkham—everything must be connected. You’re certain now where
        you must head: the lonely and dismal town of Dunwich Village.\n
    \nYou consider telling the Massachusetts State Police what you know, but the negative consequences outweigh the
        potential gain. Given the nature of your story, they would likely write your stories off as an absurd hoax.
        Worse, they could lock you up. After all, you were present in an illegal speakeasy, and you also trespassed
        in the museum. Instead, you decide to head to Dunwich yourself, in order to investigate further.\n
    \nYou pack everything you think you might need and manage to get some rest for the night. In the morning, you
        head to the train station in Northside and purchase a last-minute express ticket. Dunwich is several hours by
        train northwest along the Miskatonic River Valley. There is no train station in Dunwich, but you manage to
        phone one of Armitage’s acquaintances in the small village: a man by the name of Zebulon Whateley who was
        present during the events several months ago.\n
    \nArmitage’s notes indicate that the Whateley family is spread across many branches, some decadent and
        unscrupulous, others “undecayed” or otherwise untouched by nefarious and diabolic rites. According to
        Armitage, Zebulon’s branch of the family lay somewhere between the decayed and undecayed Whateleys, who knew
        of the traditions of his ancestors, but was not corrupted by them. He agrees to pick you up at the closest
        station and drive you into town.\n
    \nAs the train departs from Arkham, you feel the events of the previous night catching up to you, and exhaustion
        sets in. But before you can safely reach your destination, the train car suddenly rumbles and shakes,
        startling you out of your reverie. The train loudly skids to a violent halt, and you hear a rattling noise
        behind you…</string>

    <string name="blood_introduction">When you finally reach Dunwich, you are greeted by Zebulon Whateley and Earl
        Sawyer, another man from the village who had met with Dr. Armitage during the incident several months ago.
        “Things ain’t lookin’ too good here,” Earl tells you. “Some folk up and went missin’ a few nights ago. ‘Dem
        whippoorwills won’ shut up. Dunno what yer doin’ here, but last time you Arkham folk came ‘round it was bad
        news. Very bad news.” His eyes blink rapidly, and he coughs and looks away.\n
    \n“Look, why don’t you rest fer the night an’ look fer whatever it is yer looking fer t’morra,” Zebulon chimes
        in, putting a wrinkled hand on your shoulder. You begin to protest, but your aching muscles and weary mind
        won’t allow you to refuse. The elderly man offers to take you in for the night, and drives you to his home at
        the outskirts of Dunwich village. The town is disheveled and eerie, and you find yourself wishing you hadn’t
        come here at all. You fall asleep on the ride over and scarcely remember anything else from that night.\n
    \nWhen you awaken, you find that Zebulon’s house is abandoned, and there is no sign of the elderly man, or of Mr.
        Sawyer. Fearing the worst, you head into the village of Dunwich to investigate, hoping to find answers.</string>

    <string name="survivors_interlude">Inside the chamber that contained the terrible beast, you find the missing
        townsfolk and the others from Arkham; they are bound and shackled. You also find several documents that
        suggest the creature you found isn’t the only one of its kind in Dunwich. You free the creature’s victims
        from their bonds, and they offer you their thanks. You begin to plan your next move.</string>
    <string name="survivors_interlude_one">\n“It is far worse than we had thought,” Dr. Armitage says, pale and
        trembling. “Wilbur Whateley was only the beginning. There were more, many more in Dunwich, who knew of the
        ‘Great Old Ones’ and who desired power and knowledge above all else, the Earth be damned. I knew I should
        have burned that wretch’s journal. But thanks to its contents, I know how we can stop them. We are the only
        ones who can! Now quickly, help me with this solution—the powder is the key, yes, the powder is the only
        way…”\n

    <string name="survivors_interlude_two">\nProfessor Rice adjusts his glasses and studies the documents and arcane
        manuscripts left in the chamber. “I thought this nightmare was over and done with,” he sighs. “But we have a
        duty to see this through. We have to stop these creatures, or it won’t be just Dunwich in trouble. The powder
        mixture Armitage created to see the creatures will be our saving grace,” he explains, and sets off to the
        task of recreating the powder.\n

    <string name="survivors_interlude_three">\n“Thank you for everything you’ve done,” Dr. Morgan says, taking count
        of your provisions and ammunition. “Last time, we needed some of that strange powder Armitage concocted to
        even see the beast that terrorized Dunwich. If there’s more of those things out there, we’re going to need
        that powder. I think I remember how he made it…”\n

    <string name="survivors_interlude_four">\n“Dunwich’s had its fair share of oddities,” Zebulon explains to you
        with a quavering voice, “but I ain’t ever seen anything as sick and twisted as this…this…<b>thing</b>.” He
        gives the creature’s remains one last sickened glance before closing the door to the chamber behind him,
        shuddering. He locks eyes with you, his expression grim. “Whoever dun this gotta pay. I’ll do all I can to

        much of a fighter or anythin’, but I’ll do all I can. Jus’…don’t make me look at anythin’ like that <b>beast

    <string name="undimensioned_introduction">Your search of the village of Dunwich has uncovered a number of
        documents, journal entries, and esoteric theories. Reading through these materials leaves you exhausted and
        emotionally drained. Most of the content was written by a single source—a man named Seth Bishop. When you ask
        around town, you learn that Seth is a citizen of Dunwich. Along with several others, Seth had witnessed
        firsthand the devastation wrought by the events of “the Dunwich horror,” as Armitage had dubbed the incident.
        Curiously, since that time, very few people had seen Seth around town, and those who did claimed his eyes had
        been bloodshot and his face sweaty and pale.\n
    \nYou don’t doubt that somebody who has seen what Seth has seen would appear nervous or paranoid. But the more
        you read of his frantic and unhinged writings, the more you believe he is involved in recent events. His
        writings speak of having “gathered the remains” and of using arcane methods to “imbue the fathers’ essence”
        into other creatures, and eventually, into other people. The explanations and diagrams that follow are
        unfathomably complex and defy understanding.\n
    \nBefore you are able to find Seth and confront him, several men and women from the village approach you in a
        panic. “It’s back!” one of them wails. You recognize him as Curtis Whateley, of the undecayed branch.
        “Whatever it was that killed them Fryes, it’s back! Up and smashed the Bishops’ home like it were made o’
        paper!” Curtis and the other townsfolk are clamoring amongst themselves, raising their voices in a panic
        .</string>
    <string name="undimensioned_introduction_option_one">You try to calm down the townsfolk in order to learn more.</string>
    <string name="undimensoned_introduction_option_two">You try to warn the townsfolk and convince them to evacuate.</string>
    <string name="undimensioned_introduction_one">You aim to calm the townsfolk so they can explain to you what is
        going on. They inform you that there was a rumbling to the north, and when they went to investigate they
        found the Bishops’ farmhouse had been torn to shreds. A trail of heavy tracks led into nearby Cold Spring
        Glen. “You know what to do, right? You Arkham folk stopped that thing last time,” one of the townsfolk says.
        Curtis shakes his head and bites at his lip.\n
    \n“We couldn’t even see that hellish thing until the old professor sprayed that there powder on it,” He says. “To
        this day, I wish I hadn’t seen it at all…” Something must be done to stop the monster’s rampage. But, if the
        documents you found are true, there may be more than one such creature on the loose….</string>
    <string name="undimensioned_introduction_two">You warn the townsfolk that they are in grave danger, and urge them
        to flee Dunwich while they can. Several of them immediately heed your advice, remembering the terrible
        monstrosity that had previously endangered the town. Curtis drops to his knees in despair, sweating
        feverishly. “It’s that <b>thing</b> again, ain’t it? It’s come back fer us,” Curtis stutters. “I hope you’ve
        got some of that powder the old professor had last time. We couldn’t even see the damned thing until he
        sprayed it. To this day, I wish I hadn’t seen it at all…” Something must be done to stop the monster’s
        rampage. But, if the documents you found are true, there may be more than one such creature on the loose…

    <string name="doom_introduction_one">You awaken to the sound of screeching. Fearing the worst, you grab your
        equipment and head out into the streets of Dunwich. As soon as you step outside, you sense a foulness in the
        cold night air: an awful, pungent smell that can scarcely be described and a heaviness to the atmosphere that
        makes it difficult to breathe. The citizens of Dunwich have sealed their doors, and the town feels quiet and
        lonesome. In the distance, a faint glow emanates from a hilltop above the village. You know of this hill from
        both your interactions with Zebulon and Armitage’s records. It is called Sentinel Hill. The tales speak of

        to this. If the foul ritual Seth seeks to perform has anything to do with what Armitage and his colleagues
        prevented several months back, it involves the favor of an ancient creature—<b>Yog‑Sothoth</b>. Failing to

        \nThe path leading up Sentinel Hill is narrow and too torn up for Zebulon’s
        truck, so you park at the base of the hill and prepare to make the rest of the trip on foot. Just then, you
        notice that you are not alone. Several men and women emerge from the woods behind you, brandishing firearms
        and lining you up in their sights. You raise your hands and brace for the worst. “Wait,” one of them says,
        raising his hand to the others. “I recognize you from the Clover Club.” He grins toothily and lowers his
        weapon. “Naomi sends her regards.”\n
    \nCurious, you ask what the gangsters are doing here. “Ms. O’Bannion had us investigate the attack on her
        fiancé’s club,” he explains. “Turns out there were some men in Arkham behind the whole thing. Some Bishop
        fellow and his lackeys. We tailed them all the way to this dump.” Before he can explain further, the
        all-too-familiar ratta-tat of a tommy gun echoes across the hill. “That’ll be Vinny. Come on, boys!” He
        beckons to the others to follow and runs up the hill. Shaking your head, you do the same. These mobsters
        don’t know what they’re getting into.</string>

    <string name="lost_introduction">Passing through the gate is unlike anything you’ve ever experienced. You feel
        your body twisting and distorting, churning through realities as the gate pulls you to its ultimate
        destination—a place beyond the scope of human imagination.\n
    \nSuddenly, all is quiet and the chaos of the journey is replaced with a sense of solitude and dread. You are in
        an unfathomable place, vast beyond your ability to reason and utterly alien besides. The landscape is surreal
        and strange, the architecture impossible. You are so far from home that home has become a threadbare dream
        you can barely recall. Even should you find a way out of this awful place, you may never be the same again

    <string name="dunwich_epilogue_one">Six months had passed, and life for Curtis Whateley was finally returning to
        normal. Since they’d hushed up the incident and the authorities kept their distance from these parts, Mr.
        Osborn had auctioned off the Ericks and Bishop families’ belongings. Joe took a few trinkets for himself, of
        course, but Curtis wanted nothing to do with it. Folk already didn’t trust him on account of his family’s
        sins, even though he’d been attending church on the regular and had stayed far away from anything resembling
        the arcane.\n
    \nEven so, Curtis could not shake a sense of foreboding. He’d seen the devastation that befell the Ericks,
        Bishop, and Frye homes. He’d even seen firsthand the creature the folks from Arkham had banished. Some days,
        his thoughts led him to Wilbur Whateley’s farm, where he would stand outside and stare for hours, too scared
        to enter, but too curious to leave. Maybe there was something in there that could make these terrible visions
        depart. Something that could give him strength enough to resist the nightmares. Curtis decided he would find
        it.</string>
    <string name="dunwich_epilogue_two">Gené knelt closer to the ground to examine the sign in the dirt. The shape of
        the sign was foreign to her, and the tracks that had led to it were unlike any she’d ever seen. Coupled with
        the report from the university…she wasn’t sure what to think. “Ms. Beauregard,” her assistant called out to
        her, “have you found something?”\n
    \nGené stood and turned to face the freshman who’d been assigned to her. He was a good kid and a bit callow, but
        a hard worker and eager to prove himself. “This place was supposed to be cordoned off,” Gené responded.
        “Nobody’s lived here for months. And yet, see for yourself: their primitive rites continue to this day.”\n
    \nThe student approached and joined Gené in examining the sign, flipping through the pages of his journal to
        reference its symbols. “What do you think it means?” he asked. She shook her head. Outsiders rarely traveled
        to Dunwich, and all the signposts leading to the village had been taken down. But these days, even the
        townsfolk who had called this place home had abandoned it.\n
    \n“I don’t know,” Gené admitted. “But somebody is here, and this isn’t the first sign we’ve seen like this.
        Stories say there’s an altar where the townsfolk would conduct pagan rituals atop that hill. Maybe we’ll find
        more up there.</string>

        recite the Latin incantation, and find that the words come effortlessly to your tongue, as though recalled
        from an earlier memory. The creature’s body begins to shrink and melt away as the incantation builds, its
        cries terrifying and haunting. In the end, all that is left is the disfigured corpse of a man—Silas Bishop.

        of them says, looking up at the starry sky from the top of Sentinel Hill.\n

        several corpses on the ground.\n

    \n“Why, so they can laugh at us again?” Curtis spits. “They ain’t never gonna believe us ‘bout all this anyway.”
